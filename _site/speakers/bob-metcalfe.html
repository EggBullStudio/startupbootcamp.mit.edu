<p>Dr. Robert M. Metcalfe, a General Partner of <a href="http://www.polarisventures.com/">Polaris Venture Partners</a> since 2001. Bob had three other careers in technological innovation before venture capitalist:</p>
<p>While an engineer-scientist (1965-1979), Bob was an Internet pioneer. In 1973, at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (Parc), he invented Ethernet, the local-area networking (<span class="caps">LAN</span>) standard on which he shares four patents. Today, nearly a billion wired and WiFi Ethernet ports are shipped annually.</p>
<p>While an entrepreneur-executive (1979-1990), Bob founded, IPOed, and grew 3Com Corporation, the billion-dollar networking company, as Chairman, <span class="caps">CEO</span>, division GM, and VP of engineering, sales, marketing, and strategy. In 2010, 3Com merged into HP.</p>

For eight years, he wrote a syndicated Internet column read weekly by a million information technologists. He spoke at conferences, on radio and television, hosted a weekly webcast, and was executive producer of events including ACM97, ACM1, Agenda, PopTech, and Vortex.</p>
<p>Bob&#8217;s books include Packet Communication, Internet Collapses, and Beyond Calculation.</p>
<p>Bob serves on boards of Polaris-backed start-ups including 1366 Technologies, Ember, Infinite Power Solutions, SiOnyx, and Sun Catalytix. He is a director-trustee-advisor to Avistar Communications, <span class="caps">USC</span> Stevens, Ocean Energy Institute, X Prize Foundation, and MITâ€™s Corporation, Energy Initiative, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Department of Chemistry, Deans of Engineering and Science.</p>
<p>Bob graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1969 with two bachelor degrees, in electrical engineering and in industrial management. He received a master in applied mathematics from Harvard University in 1970. In 1973, he received a Ph.D. in computer science from Harvard for his dissertation, Packet Communication.</p>
<p>In 1980, the Association for Computing Machinery (<span class="caps">ACM</span>) gave Bob its Hopper Award. In 1988, he received the Bell Medal from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (<span class="caps">IEEE</span>). In 1995, Bob received the Exploratorium Award for Public Understanding of Science and was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1996, he received the IEEE&#8217;s Medal of Honor. In 1997, he was elected to the National Academy of Engineering (where he serves on the Finance Committee), and in 1999, to the International Engineering Consortium. In 2003, Bob received the Marconi Prize and was inducted into the Bay Shore High School Hall of Fame. In 2005, Bob received the National Medal of Technology for &#8220;leadership in the invention, standardization, and commercialization of Ethernet.&#8221; Bob entered the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2007 and Computer History Museum Hall of Fellows in 2008. He cherishes his five honorary degrees.</p>
