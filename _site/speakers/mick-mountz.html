<h3>Mick Mountz</h3>
<p><span class="caps">CEO</span> and Founder, <a href="http://www.kivasystems.com">Kiva Systems</a></p>
<p>Mick founded Kiva Systems in January 2003 after spending thirteen years in high tech product development, manufacturing, operations and marketing. Prior to Kiva, Mick worked on a business process team at Webvan designing a next generation distribution strategy for grocery home delivery, during which he experienced first-hand the high cost of order fulfillment and the inflexibility of existing material handling systems. Prior to joining Webvan, Mick spent three years in product marketing at Apple Computer as a Product Manager where he helped move many new technologies into the standard desktop platform including FireWire, <span class="caps">DVD</span>, Fast Ethernet, and 3D graphics acceleration. He began his career at Motorola, where he spent seven years working as both a Mechanical and a Manufacturing Engineer. In 2008 Mick was a winner of the Ernst &amp; Young Entrepreneur Of The Year® Award in the New England region, and in 2009 under Mick’s leadership Kiva was ranked #6 on the Inc. 500 list of the fastest growing companies in America. Mick holds five United States technology patents. He earned a Bachelor of Science in mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a Master of Business Administration degree from Harvard Business School.</p>
