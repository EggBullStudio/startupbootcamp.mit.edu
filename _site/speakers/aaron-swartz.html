<h3>Aaron Swartz</h3>
<p>Founder	<a href="http://infogami.com/blog/introduction">Infogami</a></p>
<p>Aaron Swartz (born November 8, 1986) is a writer, activist, and programmer. He is currently co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee.</p>
<p>At age 14, he was a co-author of the <span class="caps">RSS</span> 1.0 specification. Since then he has become a member of the W3C&#8217;s <span class="caps">RDF</span> Core Working Group, co-designed the formatting language Markdown with John Gruber, and has been involved in many other projects.</p>
<p>Swartz was the founder of Infogami, a startup that was part of Y Combinator&#8217;s first Summer Founders Program. Previously, he attended Stanford University for a year, leaving to work on his company full-time. Infogami merged with reddit to form not a bug but failed to take off.</p>
<p>In late 2006, reddit was sold to CondéNet (the online arm of Condé Nast Publications and the owners of Wired) and Swartz moved with his company to San Francisco.</p>
<p>In September 2007, Swartz, together with Simon Carstensen, launched Jottit, a website service quite similar to Infogami. Jottit was launched from bitbots.net, a project by Swartz and Carstensen. Swartz is also the creator of the web.py web application framework, based on the Python programming language, which is used by Jottit (and previously reddit).</p>
<p>Swartz is an active blogger and has written a number of widely read essays on his blog. Two of his more well-known pieces are â€œWho Writes Wikipediaâ€, an article examining the contributions to Wikipedia articles written during his candidacy for the Wikimedia Foundation board election in 2006, and â€œHOWTO: Be More Productiveâ€,<sup class="footnote" id="fnr3"><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup> an article on personal productivity.</p>
<p>Swartz currently lives in Cambridge, Mass. He works on Open Library and watchdog.net and is on the board of Change Congress.</p>
