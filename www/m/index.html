        </div>
        <div class="bio">
          <p>Angus co-founded Tellme, a prominent Silicon Valley technology firm that grew a profitable business to more than $100 million in sales and over 300 employees with $238 million in backing from Kleiner Perkins and Benchmark Capital, among other investors. In 2007, Microsoft acquired Tellme in its largest-ever acquisition of a private company. Angus subsequently guided speech recognition product strategy across Microsoft for two years before leaving in 2009 to explore new opportunities.</p>
          <p>Prior to Tellme, Angus joined Netscape Communications in 1996, bypassing college to become the company's youngest employee at age 18. At Netscape, Angus worked in the office of the CTO and later he was product manager for the flagship Web browser and the Web rendering engine known as ‚ÄúGecko.‚Äù In an ironic twist, he played a key role in the anti-trust suit against Microsoft. He participated in the AOL/Netscape merger and in establishing Mozilla.org, one of the first commercial forays into open source software.</p>
          <p>Angus has addressed numerous industry conferences on technology and business. He has spoken on entrepreneurship at Stanford, Harvard, Berkeley and Brown University, among others, and he has appeared in every major US business and technology media outlet, including CNBC, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, BusinessWeek, C|Net and others. In 2006 BusinessWeek named him one of the top ten entrepreneurs under age 30.</p>
          <p>A New England native, Angus visits Silicon Valley often but now calls Providence, RI home. Outside business, his passion is improving K-12 public education. In 2007, Rhode Island‚Äôs Governor appointed Angus to the Board of Regents, the state‚Äôs chief education policy body. In just two years, Angus led a major expansion of the charter school law and passed regulations to allow new teacher programs like Teach for America. Angus recruited a nationally acclaimed leader to become Rhode Island‚Äôs Commissioner of Education, replacing a 17-year incumbent. Motivating this work is Angus‚Äô goal to close the achievement gap, as Rhode Island‚Äôs Latino-White gap is the largest in the nation and not a single urban district middle school in the state has even half its students performing at grade level in any subject measured (reading, writing or mathematics).</p>

          <p>Drew graduated from MIT and wrote the first lines of code for Dropbox while at a train station in Boston. These days he's usually out and about running Dropbox's business affairs, but he still contributes a lot to Dropbox's client software. In the little free time he has, Drew can be found jamming on his guitar.</p>

        <div class="bio">
          <p>Dan Bricklin, with a BS in CS/EE and an MBA, is a software developer, entrepre- neur, and longtime blogger. He is best known for co-developing VisiCalc, the first PC spreadsheet program, and has continued developing a variety of products to this day, including many for the Internet.</p>
          <p>Dan will tell us some of the history of that development, talk about where some of computer technology is going today, and take your questions. He brings lots of photos and some video to augment his talk.</p>
          <p>VisiCalc was the first spreadsheet program available for personal computers. It may well be the application that turned the microcomputer from a hobby for computer enthusiasts into a serious business tool, making it the first 'killer app.' VisiCalc sold over 700,000 copies in six years.</p>
