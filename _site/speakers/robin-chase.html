It&#8217;s about people using the Internet to work together in the service of one another.&quot;&quot;</p>
<p>Zipcar provides a platform for people to share cars; GoLoco, a platform to share rides.

She has received many honors and awards, including Time 100 Most Influential People, the Massachusetts Governor&#8217;s Award for Entrepreneurial Spirit, Start-up Woman of the Year, Business Week&#8217;s top 10 designers, Fast Company&#8217;s Fast 50 Champions of Innovation, technology and innovation awards from Fortune, <span class="caps">CIO</span>, and InfoWorld magazines, and numerous environmental awards from national, state and local governments and organizations.</p>
